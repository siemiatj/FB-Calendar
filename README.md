FB-Calendar
===========

Facebook-style inspired calendar view which I've been given as an interview task for Facebook in 2013.

My demo :

The task
========

Given a set of events, render the events on a single day calendar (similar to Outlook, Calendar.app, and Google Calendar). There are several properties of the layout:

* 1) No events may visually overlap.
* 2) If two events collide in time, they must have the same width.
* 3) An event should utilize the maximum width available, but constraint 2) takes precedence over this constraint.

Each event is represented by a JS object with a start and end attribute. The value of these attributes is the number of minutes since 9am. So {start:30, end:90) represents an event from 9:30am to 10:30am. The events should be rendered in a container that is 620px wide (600px + 10px padding on the left/right) and 720px (the day will end at 9pm). The styling of the events should match the attached screenshot.

You may structure your code however you like, but you must implement the following function in the global namespace. The function takes in an array of events and will lay out the events according to the above description.

function layOutDay(events) {
}

This function will be invoked from the browserâ€™s JavaScript console for testing purposes. If it cannot be invoked, the submission will be rejected. In your submission, please implement the calendar with the following input and style the calendar accordingly.

[ {start: 30, end: 180}, {start: 540, end: 600}, {start: 560: 620}, {start: 610, end: 670} ]


My Solution
===========

Tested in Latest FF, Chrome, Safari, and IE8-10 (6-7 doesn't support box-sizing so a js
polyfill would be needed).

Wrapped in an anonymous function to keep the global scope clean. This solution may be overcomplicated but I don't
know any filling algorithm that suits here. Details are in the comments of the functions. Steps of the solution :

* - add events to array and sort them by start value (and index at which they were added)
* - find which events are overlapping
* - calculate the position of events using knowledge about overlapping and position of already rendered events
* - prepare html string that will be inserted in the dom
* - render events

As described in the doc, a global function layOutDay was created which accepts an object or array of objects. Type of
start/end parameters is not checked.

## Installation

Having node and npm installed run :

`npm install`

## Running

`npm start`

will launch a dev server at `localhost:8080`
